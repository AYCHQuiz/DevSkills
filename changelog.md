# Changelog for Evergreen Skills for Software Developers

This file keeps a log of version releases. This file is maintained
[following best practices about changelogs](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Versioning guideline

* Each significant change should be described in the "unpublished" section
* Entry versions should follow the following:
** Syntax:
*** [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
** Convention:
*** For X.Y.Z, increment the digit following this scheme:
**** X = breaking change (previous version is now deprecated),
**** Y = additive change (previous version is still valid),
**** Z = just a simple patch (for a typo or error).
* When a the new version is released, a new [Unreleased] section is created in the "Release Change History" below.
